# Video-app

Video-app lets the users keep their favourite videos from all the different sites in one place by pasting the link or the video's Id.

## Installation

Clone down this repository and then type npm install in the terminal.
You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.
When the installation is complete type npm start. You can visit the app on localhost:3000.

## About the project

The project is inspired by the recruitment task from [digimonkeys](http://digimonkeys.com/) company.
User can:

- add the video using links in various formats or id (currently supported sites: Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion)
- see the number of views and likes of the video
- watch videos in the app without redirection
- add videos to the favourites and toggle favourite filter
- sort the videos ( four options available)
- delete a single video or all of them
- change display mode (list or grid view)

## Project status

This project is still a work in progress. Some features I want to add in the near future:

- option to log in and keep the video in a database (right now data is stored in localstorage)
- search functionality
- possibility to add notes to the videos
